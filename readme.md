# Maze Generation Project

Maze generation library project to power a future maze generation lambda

General goals:

- rust api to generate mazes up to 100x100 units or larger
- support a variety of maze generation algorithms
- support a variety of 'encodings' (binary, PNG)

Why Rust?

- Mostly because I want to learn it
- Seemed appropriate for an efficient, mostly algorithm driven project dealing with binary data.

# TODO

## Milestone 0: Maze generation module sophisticated enough to support basic maze generation algorithms

-

## Milestone 1: Sidewinder and Binary Tree algorithm

## Milestone 2: Unbiased algorithms (Wilson's)

- As necessary, augment maze generation code to support coloring
